I developed this minesweeper game to revise concepts of react specifically hooks and functional components.
Also I wanted try this windows95 based UI component library for this classis game.
Doing this project i also saw that it was much easier for me to develop logic
since i ve been leetcoding for few months , it really made things clear.
I used dfs travelsal algo for revealing cells of the board , that part was hard to implement.
I used styled components for styles and for themeing too.
Overall i cleared my basics out and it was great building this.
